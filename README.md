Breakout Game Project by Bihan Zhuang (bz44)

Started: 01/15/2017
Finished: 01/22/2017
Hours: 30 - 40 

Resources: 
Many official Java Documentation on different built-in classes and StackOverflow Q&A.

To run: 
BreakoutMain.java

Any known bugs, crashes, or problems:
1) Very occasionally the ball clears some blocks that it does not hit.  
2) Very occasionally the ball will stick to the paddle longer than expected.
   But it will soon bounce normally again.

Extra features:
Changed/Added a few designs compared to the initial plan.
1) Launch ball with SPACE bar. (addition)
2) Ball is able to break the rocks but only with 5 hits and adds 20 points. (addition)
3) Normal blocks give 5 points when cleared. (addition)
4) All levels have one ball because it wouldn't make too much sense to have three balls
   and only needed to keep one alive at any point. (change)
5) An end page to display statistic of the past game. (addition)
6) Many ways to control game flow: cheat key, reset, lost-game and restart... (addition)

Impressions:
Definitely learned a lot during this project. It is a fairly challenging process to familiarize 
with a new library, learn to design different classes, and code with a big picture and clear 
logic throughout. Quite some time was spent refactoring the code because I was not very used to
making good designs right at the beginning.
