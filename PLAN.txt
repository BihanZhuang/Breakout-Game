I. Comment on Centipong:
The Centipong game looks very interesting to me. The color tone of the game is nice and diverse and the rules of the game 
can be easily understood. The paddle seems to be controlled by a mouse instead of keys so it can move really fast.The player 
needs not only focus on bouncing the blocks back up but also try to hit the centipedes at the top of the screen in order to 
create more blocks (lower the chance of losing) and power-ups. Interesting power-ups include slowing motion, increasing 
the paddle length, showing block trailing, and fasting forward to finish the game. The cool thing about this game is that 
when the centipedes are hit, some part of their body become bouncing blocks of varying velocities in the panel. This happens 
very smoothly and seems to adhere to the physics laws. When there are many blocks in the game panel, another cool effect is
when all the blocks are slowed down and showing their trailings. Two features I think that makes Centipong different from 
other variants are that the paddle does not have to be strictly at the bottom. It can swing up at the corners when certain 
power-ups are in use, to catch more blocks at extreme angles and the target, the centipedes, are moving instead of stationary. 

II. Levels:
   All levels will have three lives in total to begin with. 
   
-- Level 1: Blocks without "rocks" among them. One ball. 

-- Level 2: Blocks with "rocks" among them (The "rocks" can also bounce back the balls and they do not need to be cleared to 
   			pass the level). One ball. "Stations" will be present.
   			
-- Level 3: Blocks with "rocks" among them (different configuration). Three balls will be present and their speed will be 
            increased. At any moment keep at least one ball alive. "Stations" will be present.
            
-- Level 4: Block with "rocks" (different configuration). Three balls will be present and their speed will be increased from 
			Level 3. At any moment keep at least one ball alive. "Stations" and "aliens" will be present.

III. Blocks:
-- Some are able to give out power-ups when they are cleared.
-- "Rocks" that cannot be destroyed and serve as obstacles in the game.
-- Some can drop "Aliens" which the paddle should avoid. If the paddle gets hit its length will be halved for 5s. 
-- Some can drop "Ice" which would freeze the paddle for 1s. 

IV. Power ups:
-- Double paddle length for 5s.
-- Decrease the velocity of balls for 5s.
-- One extra life.

V. Paddle abilities:
-- "Catching" the ball when "C" is pressed and held, releasing it when "C" is released.
-- Capable of shooting lasers for 2s per 200 points by pressing "L" (a laser sign will appear in the status bar).
-- The paddle will be divided into three sections. The left and right sections will bounce the ball back in the exact same 
   direction as it comes. The middle section will bounce the ball according to physics (changing velocity in y direction).

VI. Cheat keys:
-- "E" makes all blocks explode.
-- "U" generates unlimited laser from the paddle.
-- Press numbers 1-4 to go to corresponding levels without clearing all the blocks. 

VII. Extras:
-- "Dessert stations" in the blocks to which the ball could be sucked in to "charge up": adding 100 points to the total score. This will 
   be an interesting target for the players to aim at while playing and adds more fun to the game.
